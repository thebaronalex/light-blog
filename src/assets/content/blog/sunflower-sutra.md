ok... so enough trying to be clever. today was a good day. Yesterday evening I set off another expedition to document more of this great new environment I find myself in. late last night I reached what must be one of the most spectacular places i've been in my life.

this heavily glaciated canyon in northern nevada serves as a miniature alps. while i couldn't drive ever to the bend in the canyon i will be going back once things warm up a bit.
